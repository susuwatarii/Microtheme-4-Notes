# Pre-Trojan War
## Troy
* Probably a popular port
* Important site for ancient activity
* War probably happened, but what about these stories are actually realistic, what do they tell us about the cultures?

## The Cyclic Poems:

1) Homeri Opera: a theogony (“birth of the gods”)
2) Titanomachia: battle b/t Olympians and Titans
3) Oidipodeia: concerns the Oedipus cycle, incl. kidnapping of Haemon
by Sphinx, solving riddle of the Sphinx by Oedipus and the marriage to
his mother
4) Thebais: on the expedition against Thebes (Seven Against Thebes)
5) Epigonoi: sons of the Seven Against Thebes; more successful than
fathers; drove Cadmeans out of Thebes
* This poem chronologically occurs in same generation as
Trojan War, but just before.
6) Cypria: preliminaries of Trojan War, incl. Wedding of Peleus &
Thetis, Judgment of Paris, Abduction of Helen
7) Iliad: alternative versions, but we have received the canon passed
down from Hellenistic period*
8) Aethiopis: Amazons & Ethiopians; mainly deaths: Penthesilea,
Thersites, Memnon, Achilles
9) Little Iliad: suicide of Ajax, fetching of Philoctetes & Neoptolemus,
Wooden Horse, Sinon and entry into Troy
10) Iliu Persis: Trojan debate over the horse, Laocoön, sack of Troy,
departure of Greeks, Aeneas leaves before the sacking
11) Nostoi: returns of heroes, murder of
Agamemnon, Orestes’ revenge, Menelaus’
homecoming
12) Odyssey: since so many nostoi referred to
in this epic, we think that it was not meant
to accompany the Nostoi of Achaeans above,
but follows
13) Telegonia: lost poem about Telegonus,
the son of Odysseus & Circe

What has been passed down to us is a lot of oral tradition and a bit of written work

## Lead up to the Trojan War (before the Iliad)
* Foundation of the walls of Troy
* The birth of Helen
* Wedding of Peleus and Thetis
* The Judgement of Paris
* Greek troops gather at Aulis

## Troy: Nine major settlements
* Laomedon: the first king of Troy
    * Said to have sacrificed some lambs(?) to get the walls built
* Apollo and Poseidon / Hesione
    * Said that Apollo and Poseidon built the walls of troy because they were so sick
* Kingdom of Priam
    * Definitely a sicko sea port
    * How could people build structures this large?

## Leda and the Swan
* Gives birth to two eggs
    * Two eggs, four children
        * Polydeuceus and Helen, children of Zeus
            * Polydeuceus traded his immortality with his brother on alternating days in exchange for his son
        * Castor and Clytemnestra, children of Tyndareus

## Helen
* The most beautiful woman in the world
* The face that launched a thousand ships
* Wife of Menelaus, future king of Sparta
* Often gets a bad rap in mythology

## The Oath of Tyndareus
* All suitors shall defend Tyndareus' choice
    * Tyndareus is a trickster character
    * Chooses Menelaus to marry Helen
* If anyone kidnaps Helen by force, all suitors must unite to return her

## Paris (or Alexander) on Mt. Ida
* Son of Priam and Hecuba, king and queen of Troy
* Hecuba's dream
  * Gave birth to fire that burned the entire city of Troy
  * Seer said it was going to be her baby
* Paris was left to the elements and found by some shepherds, who take him in and give him the name Paris
* Funeral games held at Troy for him
  * Reward is Paris' personal boar
  * Paris wins all the games, what a legend
* Priam find out it's Paris, accepts him back into the kingdom
* Still hangs out w/ the shepherds on Mt. Ida though now a prince of Troy

## The Wedding of Peleus and Thetis
* Eris & the apple of "discord"
  * Eris is strife, don't want strife at wedding
  * Hera throws golden apple "to the most beautiful"
  * Argument ensues
* Etymology of Panope and Galene

## The Judgement of Paris
* Hera, Athena, Aphrodite
* Who's the most beautiful
* Says Aphrodite, gets Helen as his reward
* Athena and Hera now have scorn, are on the Trojan side of the war

* Paris steals away Helen when he's visiting Troy

## Menelaus and Agamemnon invoke the Oath of Tyndareus
* Greeks gather at Aulis
* Draft dodgers? (Odysseus and Achilles)
  * Shaming culture
  * Large theme in the Iliad
  * Greeks gather at Aulis as a result
* Sacrifice of Iphigenia

## Draft Dodger #1: Odysseus
* Odysseus and Palamedes
  * Odysseus tries to feign madness to get out of the war
  * Palamedes drops Odysseus' child in front of his crazy antics
  * Odysseus stops

## Draft Dodger #2: Achilles
* Thetis hides Achilles away 
* Dresses him up as a girl
* The Greeks need Achilles because...
  * Seer Calchis hears and understands prophecy that Greeks need Achilles to win the war
* How do they find Achilles?
  * Odysseus hatches a plan
  * Shows chest filled with jewels and weapons to the girls
  * Achilles is attracted to the weapons
  * **Story pattern:** cross dressing, like Heracles, and masculinity shows through


## Achilles (birth, youth, death)
* Prince of the Mrymidons
* From Phthia
* Peleus chosen for his arete ("excellence")
  * Overall excellence
    * Argonaut
    * Took part in Calydonian boar hunt
    * (both took place a gen before the war)
* Peleus and Thetis got together because Prometheus told Zeus that Thetis' child would kill the father
* Birth story
* River Sytx (Achilles' heel)
  * Thetis goes down to the river styx to dip in her baby Achilles
  * Gets caught, enraged
  * Only thing that wasn't dipped into the river was his heel
* Chiron
  * Mentors Achilles
  * Like Linus tutored Heracles, Chiron did to Achilles

## Phoenix, tutor of Achilles at Phthia and Troy
* Wise elder throughout the Iliad
  * Achilles is really close to him
* Patroclus
  * Commits murder over a dice game as a child
  * When Peleus takes him in, about same age as Achilles
  * Get extremely close
  * Possibly homo with Achilles
  
## Gathering at Aulis:
* A guide, Telephus: "onyl that which harmed you can cure you"
  * Sees snake eat sparrow and her children
  * "We'll be outside of Troy for 9 years until the 10th year when troy  falls
  * "Must sacrifice Iphigenia"
  * "Fleet won't sail"

## Philoctetes on Lemnos
* Only one said to be brave enough to light the pyre that killed Heracles
* Was given Heracles' bow and arrow set
* "The only way you'll win the battle is if you have the bow and arrow set of Philoctetes
* Philoctetes steps on a snake and gets bitten
* Becomes really painful and infected
* Wound smells so Greeks drop him off on Lemnos
* Greeks come back after they hear the prophecy and they bring him back to troy and fulfill the prophecy

## What is Epic?
* Monumental form of poetry
* Celebrates values and achievements of a culture

## Homer's Iliad
* Poetry was always sung by Greeks
* 5% could read give or take
* History was passed down through oral tradition centered around stories containing themes we want to pass down
* Combat, morals, how to train for combat, war itself, how to treat enemy, dead, what is virtue? How do we gain virtue in the public/private sphere? Honor? 
* Also a way to learn to read/write

* Written by just one person?
  * Probably not
* From studies on south slavic bards
  * Very possible for illiterate bards to memorize huge amounts of material
  * No 2 performances were ever the same
  * Bards drew on a bunch of different themes as he went along
  * Dactyllic Hexameter
    * Sung by following fixed epithets
    * If you want to develop anger, sing in a different way
